            <h2>Can Computers Learn Common Sense?</h2>

            <p>A computer scientist named Yejin Choi says common sense is the “dark matter” of Artificial Intelligence. 
                “It shapes so much of what we do and what we need to do, and yet its ineffable.” She states that computers are puzzled by problems called “cheeseburger stabbing.”
                This piece gives a nice overview of efforts to build that dark matter into modern algorithms, and the sometimes fraught role humans play in doing so.</p>

            <p>With the rapid devlopment of technology, an invention that would greatly help us has been made, these are drones that act like bees and help with pollinating. The robotic bees look like tiny drones and spreads the pollen across different places. They are also equipped with pesticides that is sprayed on dangerous wasps but it is not harmful to humans and other bees. The test drones have been already implemented in selected farms. </p>

            <p>Robot dogs are often trained using a mix of techniques such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Reinforcement learning is the process by which a robot learns via trial and error, receiving positive reinforcement for right acts and adjusting its behavior accordingly. In contrast, imitation learning includes the robot watching and emulating human or animal actions in order to complete specified tasks. </p>

            <p>PepsiCo is deploying Augury-powered artificial intelligence sensors across its factories, aiming to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and expedite product delivery. These sensors, trained to recognize signs of weary machines, are being deployed across the factory following a successful US trial. The technology can analyze processes in real-time, warn of future issues, and use historical data to recommend fixes.</p>
